## About Faye

Faye, the "JavaScript Magician," was responsible for adding interactivity to the website. However, her love for quirky animations sometimes backfired. One moment, the website would be smoothly transitioning between pages, and the next, visitors would find themselves trapped in a loop of dancing cupcakes.

What's more, Faye's latest addition—a spellbinding hover effect on buttons—caused some users' browsers to freeze unexpectedly, much to their confusion.
